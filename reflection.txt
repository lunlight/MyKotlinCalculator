Building the MyKotlinCalculator application was an insightful exercise that reinforced my understanding of Kotlin basics, particularly around user input handling and control flow. Initially, I encountered challenges with reading user input and converting it into the proper numeric types. I learned the importance of using readLine() effectively and checking for null values or invalid inputs. Handling division by zero also required careful consideration, teaching me the importance of validating inputs before performing operations to prevent runtime errors.

Another aspect that required attention was providing a loop to allow multiple calculations. Implementing a while loop to continuously prompt the user for actions made the application more user-friendly. Additionally, formatting the output using String.format() to two decimal places significantly improved the readability of the results, making the calculator feel more polished and professional.

Overall, this assignment helped me better understand Kotlinâ€™s type conversions, control structures like when, and error handling strategies. It was a valuable hands-on experience that will guide me in building more complex, reliable, and user-friendly console applications in the future.
